ChatGPT
To address the issue of long labels not fully showing in the figure legend, you can adjust the width of the legend or change the orientation of the legend. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Your original code
clean_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = household_income, fill = factor(depression))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "lightcyan3", "1" = "cadetblue"), 
                    labels = c("No or Mild", "Moderate or more")) +  # Shortened labels
  coord_flip() +
  labs(fill = "Depression", x = "Household Income in 2019", y = "Proportion") + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5))  # Adjusted legend position

# You can also change legend orientation if needed
# guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5, keywidth = 0.5, keyheight = 0.5)) 
In this code:

I've shortened the labels to "No or Mild" and "Moderate or more" to make them fit better in the legend.
I've adjusted the legend's position using guide_legend() by setting title.position = "top" and title.hjust = 0.5 to center the legend title.
Optionally, you can further adjust the width and height of the legend keys using keywidth and keyheight parameters if needed.
You can adjust the values of keywidth and keyheight as per your requirement to ensure that the legend keys and labels are fully visible without making the legend too large.

could you make this natural please: The survey was designed to explore the associations among exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, as well as developmental outcomes in their offspring. Although there is evidence that disasters increase symptoms of mental illness, research on the mental health consequences of pandemics is sparse.

ChatGPT
The survey aimed to investigate how exposure to the tangible challenges brought about by the pandemic, along with perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, relate to the developmental outcomes in their children. While there is some evidence suggesting that disasters can exacerbate symptoms of mental illness, there is limited research on the specific mental health impacts of pandemics.

how to make this "maternal_age" = sample(17:50, 500, replace = TRUE) include one-digit numbers, like 18.5

ChatGPT
To include one-digit numbers like 18.5 in the "maternal_age" variable, you can generate a vector that includes both integer and decimal values. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

R
Copy code
maternal_age <- c(sample(17:49, 450, replace = TRUE), seq(49.1, 50, by = 0.1))
In this modified code:

We first generate a sample of integers from 17 to 49 (inclusive) with a sample size of 450 using sample(17:49, 450, replace = TRUE).
Then, we create a sequence of decimal values from 49.1 to 50 with an increment of 0.1 using seq(49.1, 50, by = 0.1).
Finally, we combine these two vectors using the c() function to create a single vector containing both integer and decimal values for maternal ages.

I suggest that researchers prioritize investigating the impact of distress during pregnancy on birth outcomes, encompassing both the health outcomes and the language development of newborns, particularly during extended periods of staying at home.







correct my grammar and improve my writing if needed please: While pregnancy and childbirth are often moments of joy, they can also bring about distress as mothers navigate physical changes, uncertainties and responsibilities. In the 12 months before childbirth, 12.5% of women in Canada reported that most days were very stressful, while 7.5% of women reported depressive or anxious symptoms [@canadaPregnancyWomenaposs].  These figures are likely to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the heightened uncertainty and panic. Maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes for the offspring, such as hyperactivity disorder, autism, poor cognitive or emotional developmental [@MPMHPbeta], and thus, prenatal mental health is crucial for both mothers and children. In light of this, I utilize data from the Open Science Framework [@osfPregnancyDuring] to explore factors contributing to maternal depression and anxiety during the pandemic, along with associated birth outcomes. This analysis could also shed light on mothers’ mental health during other objective hardships or the general effects of prenatal distress.

Given that moderate depression and anxiety can impair daily functioning, this paper distinguishes between levels of distress and use logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of pregnant individuals experiencing at least moderate levels of depression and anxiety in Canada during the pandemic. Predictors include age, education, household income, language preference, and perceived threat to oneself and the unborn baby. The estimand being explored is whether pregnant individuals, during the pandemic, would experience at least moderate levels of depression or anxiety, as self-reported using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Scales in the survey. 

The results indicate that young pregnant individuals with lower education and income, as well as a high perception of danger to both themselves and their unborn child, are more likely to experience at least moderate depression and anxiety. Furthermore, participants who completed the survey in French demonstrated a lower likelihood of getting distress compared to those who responded in English. While the dataset used in this paper provides valuable information on pregnant participants’ demographic information, basic birth outcomes, and mental health data, it does not include any information on newborns’ health. Consequently, this paper mainly focuses on the maternal well-being and its affects on mothers.

This paper is constructed as follows: The data utilized for analysis is discussed in @sec-data. Following that, two models, one for depression and one for anxiety, is introduced in @sec-model. @sec-results then talks about the results derived from the models. Lastly, I will discuss the findings in a broader context and address limitations of this paper as well as the future explorations in @sec-discussion. This paper uses the programming language R [@r].

The prenatal mental health dataset from the Open Science Framework was designed to explore the relationship between exposure to objective hardship caused by the Covid -19 pandemic and psychological distress in pregnant individuals [@osfPregnancyDuring]. The  study population is pregnant individuals aged 17 or older, with gestation periods of no more than 35 weeks, residing in Canada. Data were collected from May 2020 to December 2021, containing demographic information, mental health data and basic birth outcomes [@nihPrenatalMental]. For this paper, I will only use data collected from May 2020 to December 2020 to analyze the prenatal mental health during the onset of the outbreak, a period highly marked by panic and hardship. 

Participants were recruited through advertisements via pregnancy organizations, care providers, social media, and paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, with the chance to win a $500 gift card. A portion of advertisements targeted geographic regions and sociodemographic groups with less representation to reduce underrepresentation [@nihPrenatalMental]. The surveys were available in either English or French. Prenatal data, including age, 2019 household income in Canadian dollars, and education level, were collected as part of the national Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) project using online questionnaires through REDCap. Birth data were also acquired using parents reports in REDCap [@nihPrenatalMental]. Depression symptoms were self-assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), consisting of 10 questions, each scored from 0 to 3, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 30 [@EDPSstanford]. Anxiety symptoms were self-assessed by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), including 7 questions, each scored from 1 to 5, with possible total scores ranging from 7 to 35 [@psychiatry]. Higher scores on both surveys indicate more severe depression or anxiety symptoms. In this paper, the EPDS scores are divided by 30, and the PROMIS scores are adjusted by subtracting 7 from the original scores and then dividing by 35, and hence, making the level of depression and anxiety between 0 and 1 to standardize the scale. 

Two new binary variables named `depression` and `anxiety` are created. Mothers scoring above 12, which represents 40% on the EPDS scale, are likely to be suffering from depression and should seek medical attention [@EDPSstanford]. Consequently, the variable `depression` is assigned to a value of 1 if the EPDS score is greater than or equal to 0.4, and 0 otherwise. The PROMIS scale scoring more than 20 indicates at least moderate depression. Hence, the variable `anxiety` is assigned to 1 if the PROMIS score is larger or equal to 0.464, and 0 if it is smaller than 0.464. 

This paper distinguishes between levels of mental health using the term ‘moderate’, as symptoms of moderate depression may become severe enough to influence daily life [@healthlineMildModerate]. Additionally, though mild anxiety may not always meet clinical significance criteria, anxiety reaching a moderate level is generally considered significant [@betterhelpWhatDifferent]. During the early stages of the pandemic, especially among pregnant individuals, there is a higher likelihood of experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms. Therefore, I will focus on the estimation of at least moderate depression/anxiety.  In this analysis, “depression” refers to being at least moderately depressed, while “no depression” indicates not reaching the level of moderate depression; “anxiety” refers to being at least moderately anxious, while “no anxiety” indicates not reaching the level of moderate anxiety. Data are available for 10,772 participants. After excluding observations with missing values and setting the delivery month from May 2020 to December 2020, 3266 observations remain. Further details regarding data cleaning can be found in @sec-appendix-cleaning. All participants in this study provided informed consent. Participants with higher education levels and higher household income exhibit lower levels of depression and anxiety.

The prenatal mental health dataset sourced from the Open Science Framework was formulated to investigate the correlation between exposure to objective hardship resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and psychological distress among pregnant individuals (OSF Pregnancy During, year). The study focuses on pregnant individuals aged 17 or older, with gestation periods not exceeding 35 weeks, residing in Canada. Data collection spanned from May 2020 to December 2021, encompassing demographic information, mental health data, and basic birth outcomes (NIH Prenatal Mental, year). For the purposes of this paper, only data collected between May 2020 and December 2020 will be analyzed to scrutinize prenatal mental health during the initial phase of the outbreak, characterized by heightened panic and adversity.

Participants were recruited through various channels, including pregnancy organizations, healthcare providers, and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, with incentives offered such as a chance to win a $500 gift card. Targeted advertising was employed to ensure representation from diverse geographic regions and sociodemographic groups, thereby mitigating underrepresentation (NIH Prenatal Mental, year). Surveys were available in both English and French. Prenatal data, including age, household income in Canadian dollars for the year 2019, and education level, were collected through online questionnaires using REDCap as part of the national Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) project. Birth data were also obtained through parent reports in REDCap (NIH Prenatal Mental, year).

Depression symptoms were self-assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), comprising 10 questions scored from 0 to 3, with total scores ranging from 0 to 30 (EPDS Stanford, year). Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), consisting of 7 questions scored from 1 to 5, yielding total scores ranging from 7 to 35 (Psychiatry, year). Higher scores on both scales indicate more severe depression or anxiety symptoms. To standardize the scale, EPDS scores were divided by 30, while PROMIS scores were adjusted by subtracting 7 from the original scores and then dividing by 35, resulting in depression and anxiety levels between 0 and 1, respectively.

Two binary variables, namely 'depression' and 'anxiety,' were created. Participants scoring above 12 on the EPDS scale, representing 40%, were considered likely to be experiencing depression and were advised to seek medical attention (EPDS Stanford, year). Accordingly, the variable 'depression' was assigned a value of 1 if the EPDS score was greater than or equal to 0.4, and 0 otherwise. For the PROMIS scale, a score exceeding 20 indicated at least moderate depression. Therefore, the variable 'anxiety' was assigned a value of 1 if the PROMIS score was greater than or equal to 0.464, and 0 if it was less than 0.464.

This paper distinguishes between levels of mental health using the term 'moderate,' as symptoms of moderate depression may significantly impact daily functioning (Healthline Mild Moderate, year). Additionally, while mild anxiety may not always meet clinical significance criteria, moderate anxiety is generally considered noteworthy (BetterHelp What Different, year). Given the higher likelihood of experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic, particularly among pregnant individuals, the focus of this analysis will be on estimating at least moderate depression/anxiety. In this context, 'depression' refers to being at least moderately depressed, while 'no depression' indicates not reaching the threshold of moderate depression. Similarly, 'anxiety' refers to being at least moderately anxious, while 'no anxiety' signifies not reaching the level of moderate anxiety. A total of 10,772 participants' data were available. After excluding observations with missing values and limiting the delivery month to May 2020 to December 2020, 3266 observations remained. Further details regarding data cleaning procedures are provided in Appendix C. All participants in this study provided informed consent. Participants with higher levels of education and household income demonstrated lower levels of depression and anxiety.

[@fig-month] provides an overview of the levels of depression and anxiety with delivery month spanning from May 2020 to December 2020. Overall, there is a decreasing trend observed in both scales with the occurrence of the pandemic. On average, the level of anxiety tends to be slightly higher than that of depression, with the majority experiencing depression levels below 0.5. However, depression exhibits more higher outliers, implying that some individuals experience significantly severe depression symptoms compared to the average. Mothers scoring above 12 or 13, which represents 40%, are likely to be suffering from depression and should seek medical attention [@EDPSstanford]. Hence, the distributions in [@fig-month] indicate a considerable number of pregnant individuals may be experiencing distress, given that the means fall within the range of 0.3 to 0.5.

The mean age of mothers at the time of delivery in Canada is approximately 31 [@statcanMeanMother]. Since the dataset contains maternal ages ranging from 18.5 to 49, and 35 and above is categorized as advanced maternal age [@nihMaternalRisk], I have grouped the ages as follows: Under 27, 27 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 and above. The distribution of pregnant individuals’ ages and household incomes is illustrated in [@fig-income_age], and the relationship between age and education is depicted in [@fig-education_age]. Both graphs shows that a significant proportion of participants fall within the 27 to 34 age group, followed by those aged 35 to 39. Surprisingly, the number of participants under 27 is very low, almost comparable to those aged 40 and above. 

Regarding household income in 2019, a large proportion of respondents reported incomes ranging from 70,000 to 149,999 as indicated in [@fig-income_age]. There is a notable presence of households with incomes exceeding 200,000, while very few households reported incomes below 40,000. For reference, the median after-tax income of Canadian households was 73,000 in 2020, and 11.1% of Canadians were in low-income group [@statcanIncomeCanada]. [@fig-education_age] demonstrates that the majority of pregnant individuals in the survey hold undergraduate degrees, with some having completed college/trade school or earned Master’s degrees. Very few respondents reported having less than a high school diploma. According to Statistics Canada, in 2021, 26.3% of women+ aged 15 and above hold high school diploma, 21.2% had college, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma. 58.4% hold postsecondary certificate, while 5.9% completed Master’s Degree [@statcanHighestLevel].

[@fig-income_education_dep_anx] displays the proportions of participants with less than moderate levels of depression/anxiety and those with at least moderate depression/anxiety, categorized by household income in 2019 and education. There is a correlation between higher education and higher household income with lower levels of both depression and anxiety.

Given the similarity between questions 1 and 2, which respectively focus on self-perceived danger and danger perceived towards the unborn, I will analyze the responses to these questions, but the relationship between question 2 and 3 concerning the baby will be presented in @sec-appendix-questions. Scores are divided by 100, resulting in a range from 0 to 1. The relationship between the perceived level of danger, both towards self and the unborn, and prenatal mental health is visualized in [@fig-danger].

[@fig-danger] (a) and (b) reveals that compared to perceived level of the unborn baby, a higher perceived level of danger to oneself tends to lend to a higher level of depression. From [@fig-danger] (c) and (d), it appears that the perceived level of danger to both oneself and the unborn baby seem to have similar impacts on the mental health of pregnant individuals. Again, the average level of distress among French speakers is lower than that among English speakers, but participants who speak French have a higher variation. 

Therefore, the predictors I choose to estimate the prenatal mental health are maternal age groups, household income, education, the perceived danger to oneself, and the perceived danger to the unborn baby.

To estimate whether pregnant individuals will experience depression or anxiety beyond moderate levels, I will utilize logistic regression to create separate models for each psychological distress, using the `stan_glm()` function from the `rstanarm` package [@rrstanarm]. The predictors are age group, education, household income, language, the perceived level of danger to oneself, and the perceived level of danger to the unborn baby. It is important to recognize that a model is not, and cannot be, a true representation of reality [@tellingstorieswithdata]. The purpose of a model is to identify patterns in the data and make estimations, so models are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. 

Logistic regression is well-suited when the outcome variable is binary. For these two models, the outcome variables `depression` and `anxiety` are assigned to 1 if participants exhibit at least moderate symptoms and 0 otherwise. The logistic regression equation for both models can be expressed as follows:

For the depression model, I expect to see a positive relationship between experiencing at least moderate depression and age under 27, low levels of education (e.g. less than high school diploma), low income household in 2019 (e.g. less than 20,000), and preference of using English. This expectation is based on @sec-data. Moreover, at the onset of the pandemic, when everything was uncertain, it is reasonable that participants with lower income would worry more about the pregnancy, because financial strain can contribute to limited access to resources such as healthcare. Younger individuals or those with lower levels of education may experience increased depression due to limited life experience or reduced access to information. Pregnant individuals who perceive a higher level of threat to themselves or their unborn baby may also experience heightened stress levels.

For the anxiety model, I also expect a positive relationship between experiencing at least moderate depression and age under 27, low levels of education and income, a preference of speaking English, and high perception of danger to both self and unborn baby. This is based on @sec-data as well.

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic was a substantial stressor, especially for pregnant individuals. Since depression and anxiety beyond moderate levels are considered clinically significant, this paper uses Bayesian model and logistic regression to evaluate the probability of experiencing at least moderate levels of prenatal depression or anxiety during the pandemic. The analysis reveals that the perceived threats to oneself and the unborn child are strongly correlated to the mental distress, especially among younger pregnant individuals with lower levels of education and from lower-income families.

The analysis indicates that younger age, low levels of education and household income, and a high perception of danger to both oneself and the unborn are associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.
The coefficients from the logistic regression model, presented in [@tbl-depression_model], reveal the impact of various predictors on whether a pregnant individual would experience at least moderate depression. Age groups 27 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 and above all exhibit negative coefficients, suggesting a lower likelihood of depression in individuals aged 27 and above. The general trend in income is that a higher household income positively correlates with a lower probability of depression, but the highest income category, 200,000 and above, shows a slightly higher coefficient than the second higher income range of 175,000 to 199,999. Similarly, higher levels of education are associated with lower depression levels, with the highest level, the Doctoral Degree holders, having slightly larger coefficients than those with  the second highest degree, the Master’s degrees. Individuals who use French have a negative coefficient, implying a smaller likelihood of depression. The perceived threats to oneself and the unborn baby exhibit large positive coefficients, and the threat to life has a larger coefficient than the threat to the baby.

The threat to life has a larger coefficient than the threat to the baby, meaning feeling the threat to life can lead to more severe depression.

ChatGPT
The threat to life has a larger coefficient than the threat to the baby, indicating that feeling the threat to life can lead to more severe depression.
The coefficients from the logistic regression model for anxiety, presented in Table [@tbl-anxiety_model], shows the influence of predictor variables on whether a pregnant individual would experience at least moderate anxiety. Age groups 27 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 and above have negative coefficients from [@tbl-anxiety_model], indicating a reduced likelihood of anxiety in people aged 27 and above, particularly in the 35 to 39 age group. Higher household income is associated with a lower probability of anxiety, with the income range of 175,000 to 199,999 showing the lowest coefficient. While higher levels of education correspond to lower anxiety levels, the differences are less evident compared to the depression model. To be more specific, the highest degree Doctoral Degree has coefficient -0.695, which is between the coefficients of College/trade school and Undergraduate degree, with coefficients -0.642 and -0.705 respectively. Pregnant individuals that speak French has a negative coefficient which implies a lower likelihood of anxiety as well. The perceived threat to oneself and the unborn baby exhibit large positive coefficients and are larger than the coefficients in the depression model. The two values are similar, 1.505 and 1.555, respectively.

what does As with the depression model mean

"As with the depression model" means that similar to the findings observed in the depression model, certain variables or trends are also present in the analysis of the anxiety model. It suggests a comparison or similarity between the results of the anxiety model and those of the depression model.
As shown in @sec-results, lower household income is associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, as financial strain can significantly impact individuals’ access to essential resources, including healthcare, particularly during uncertain times. Low education has been linked to a lack of a sense of control and resilience, and exposure to day-to-day stressors [@newsmedicalDoesEducation]. These negative factors have been strongly correlated with the onset of depression and anxiety [@keytopics]. In contrast, education is shown to be a clear indicators of life outcomes such as employment, income, and social status, and hence, a highly-educated participant is prone to having fewer symptoms [@keytopics]. 

It is observed that pregnant individuals under 27 are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. This could be attributed to the fact that younger mothers have a higher likelihood of experiencing their first pregnancy compared to older mothers, and older mothers have a greater chance of having previously given birth. Young individuals often face various socioeconomic challenges, including lower income and limited time to complete their education, which can lead to lower educational attainment levels. These factors can contribute to a higher likelihood of experiencing depression and anxiety. 

When individuals perceive a threat, their bodies activate the stress response system, which is an activation of stress hormones that produce physiological changes [@nihPhysiologyStress].  More than this, individuals who perceive threats may engage in rumination and a decreased sense of control, continuously dwelling on their fears and anxieties. Thus, a high perception of threat to oneself and baby may lead to physiological disorders.

The differences in language preference is often related to the regions. Most people who prefer to speak French reside in Quebec. As Quebec being one of the provinces with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in 2020 [@COVID19Tracker], the reason behind French speakers having low level of depression and anxiety remains uncertain. It could potentially be attributed to lifestyle and cultural attitudes prevalent among Quebecers. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying factors.

Only one-third of pregnant women with depression would consider taking anti-depression treatment [@NOWWUADCWWWD]. Hence, it is critical to raise awareness of depression as a health issue and encourage individuals to seek professional help. 

Research has shown that pregnant individuals with untreated depression face significantly increased infant risks compared to those without depression, particularly in terms of preterm birth and small infant size. However, treating depression with antidepressants has also been found associated with high risks of preterm birth and low birth weight [@NOWWUADCWWWD]. In terms of these findings, non-pharmacological therapies may be more acceptable for pregnant individuals, even though conclusive evidence supporting these therapies is currently lacking [@NOWWUADCWWWD].

Study has showed that maternal distress may contribute to reduced birthweight, and complications related to preterm birth and low birth weight are leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality [@NOWWUADCWWWD]. The dataset used in this paper, from the Open Science Frame [@osfPregnancyDuring], also demonstrate a reduced birth weight and birth length related to poor mental health. As illustrated in [@fig-weight_length_delivery], there is a clear association between higher levels of depression or anxiety and lower birth weight and length, categorized by delivery mode, with Caesarean-section babies having a larger average length and weight compared to vaginally delivered babies. These findings, again, emphasize the importance of addressing maternal mental health during pregnancy to support fetal growth and development.

Participants in the study were pregnant individuals aged 17 years or older, with gestation periods of up to 35 weeks. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, potential biases of the data may occur, such as stress among young mothers under 17 years old and participants with more than 35 weeks of gestation, potentially leading to more severe depression or anxiety. This sampling bias could result in an underestimation of mental distress levels among pregnant individuals. As demonstrated in @sec-results, younger mothers tend to experience higher levels of depression and anxiety, and they are less likely to be financially stable compared to adults. It is important to understand the mental health of mothers under 17 years old, which helps .

In the survey, depression and anxiety levels were assessed through self-reported measures using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Promis Anxiety Scale, while birth length and weight were reported by parents. This reliance on self-reporting and parental reporting introduces biases and potential ethical implications that may limit the accuracy of data.

One weakness of the dataset is its lack of information on other mental disorders besides depression and anxiety, like psychosis, and geographical data. Considering that regions with different population densities may experience varying levels of panic during the pandemic, the analysis could benefit from including relevant regional data for a better precision. Moreover, some surveys were collected through social media like Facebook and Instagram Ads. These platforms may not be perceived as formal or serious compared to surveys conducted by established survey companies, meaning that respondents may not have provided accurate or complete information, potentially affecting the reliability and validity of the data collected.

While several rounds of surveys were conducted, the complete dataset containing additional information was not publicly accessible. Consequently, this paper only utilized one survey and could not analyze changes in mental distress over time or assess newborn health outcomes, representing a limitation of the study.

Given the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the escalation of conflicts and crises worldwide, understanding prenatal mental health amidst such objective hardships is useful and necessary. I recommend that researchers focus on investigating how distress during pregnancy impacts birth outcomes, including the health and developmental outcomes of newborns, as well as postnatal mental health. Future research can explore deeper into the subjective factors, such as the prolonged duration of staying at home and the attitudes of family members, in order to comprehensively assess their impacts on maternal well-being. 

The models generated from this analysis serve as a foundation for advancing discussions on resource allocation, clinical interventions and the role of familial support in aiding pregnant individuals. By identifying the multifaceted factors influencing maternal well-being and mental health outcomes, policymakers and healthcare providers can make informed decisions regarding resources allocation and targeted treatments to provide support for pregnant individuals through hardships.

Participants in the study were pregnant individuals aged 17 years or older, with gestation periods of up to 35 weeks. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, potential biases in the data may occur, such as stress among young mothers under 17 years old and participants with more than 35 weeks of gestation, potentially leading to more severe depression or anxiety. This sampling bias could result in an underestimation of mental distress levels among pregnant individuals. As demonstrated in @sec-results, younger mothers tend to experience higher levels of depression and anxiety, and they are less likely to be financially stable compared to adults. It is important to understand the mental health of mothers under 17 years old, which helps.

In the survey, depression and anxiety levels were assessed through self-reported measures using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Promis Anxiety Scale, while birth length and weight were reported by parents. This reliance on self-reporting and parental reporting introduces biases and potential ethical implications that may limit the accuracy of data.

One weakness of the dataset is its lack of information on other mental disorders besides depression and anxiety, like psychosis, and geographical data.
